> a very, very tiny FP library

[![NPM][1]][2]


## overview

this is a very, very basic collection of utilities for functional programming.
it does not handle `this` bindings, i.e. in many cases, `this` will refer to an empty object.


## setup

this is a scoped package, so don't forget to do these:

```bash
npm i @eliranmal/femto -S
```

```js
const f = require('@eliranmal/femto');
// etc.
```
